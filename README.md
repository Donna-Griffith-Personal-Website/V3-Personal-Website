Third Time's the Charm

This is my Personal Website/Portfolio to prepare for a new career in Web Development <br>
The site contains a Home Page, About-Me Page, Portfolio Page, and Contact Me Page with a working form <br>
There are 3 External Files: CSS, JS, and Form Submitted along with separate folder with Assets <br>
This is also a collaboration with @milizan <br>
There is a Corresponding Project with a README ticket created by @milizan located here: https://github.com/orgs/Donna-Griffith-Personal-Website/projects/1 <br>
